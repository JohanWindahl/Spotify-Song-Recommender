The assignment was to create the best possible model to predict like or dislike on a new set of songs. The best results achived were 83% mean accuracy.

Some models evaluated with Cross validation were: Generalized Linear Models, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, K-nearest neighbor and Random Forest.
